  <h3>New Design System Component Building Approach</h3>
  <p>One of the main objectives of the Sportsbook Product Design Team for 2023 was to redesign our 
    leading online B2B betting brand for the Nordic market. With a user base known for its conservatism, 
    the goal was to modernize the user experience and elevate the brand's appeal.</p>
  <p><strong>To achieve this goal, we revamped our current color scheme logic and implemented a new design system 
    component building method, along with an enhanced design token structure. The new approach and maintenance 
    flow not only enable designers to directly integrate production code through Figma and GitHub, resulting in a 
    faster time to market, but also play a crucial role in theme and tone switching within Figma. 
    This allows us to experiment with and easily validate new design components across our B2B and B2C brands 
    for various markets.</strong></p>
  <p>In this project, my role is to collaborate with the Principal UI Designer and Frontend Architect 
    to establish the key artifacts. Additionally, I am responsible for onboarding and co-leading the UI 
    Designers working on our Design System components.</p>

    <h4>Technical Discovery for Figma</h4>
    <p>The evolution of industry-standard design tools has progressed significantly in recent years.<br>
      We migrated our assets from Sketch to Figma a couple of years ago, and it was a challenging and 
      costly process with minimal business value. Therefore, we had to be very cautious when selecting 
      our foundations for the coming years.</p>

    <p>I reached out to Figma's business representatives to obtain information about their plans for token 
      management and plugin integration. Since their variable implementation ideas were quite basic 
      at the time and the multi-brand support would have meant an additional cost for upgrading our entire 
      organization's plan, I opted for Token Studio over their native variables after they assured us about 
      the plugin support.</p>

    <h4>Design Token Architecture Enhancements</h4>
    <p><strong>With the introduction of unified tokens, our main goals were cost-effectiveness and flexibility.</strong></p> 
    <p>To simplify component creation and UI theming, we reduced the number of structural and surface-related 
      tokens. For added flexibility, which is often requested by our B2B partners, we increased brand-level 
      properties, including so-called "product" background and complementary text colors, border radii, 
      and richer typographical elements.</p>

    <p>Based on the characteristics of cascading stylesheets responsible for rendering UI components in web browsers 
      and utilizing the different token group levels provided by the Token Studio plugin, I've designed a 
      brand new semantic 3-level token system.</p>
    <img src="assets/token-architecture-cover.jpg" alt="Multi-layered Token Architecture Scheme" />
    <p>Global structural tokens are shared across all brands and are responsible for spacings and sizings throughout 
      the entire application. Brand-level tokens are used for both light and dark themes, while theme-specific adaptive
      tokens store surface and text color values for each brand's light or dark variations.</p>
    <p>I also introduced a set of composite tokens for each respective level. For instance, typographic tokens are 
      created at the brand level from global variables (such as line height) and brand-specific properties (like font family). 
      Theme-specific text colors are interpolated with master opacity tokens to ensure consistency.</p>

    <h4>Taking our Color System to the Next Level</h4>
    <p>Originally, our products used a single tone for surface colorsâ€”either light or dark neutrals with the corresponding 
      text colors, along with their respective brand colors. However, this new token structure has enabled us to support 
      duo-tone themes.</p>
      <p><strong>Light and dark theme support has become a standard requirement in user interface design. To meet user needs 
        and perform well in our target markets, we had to establish a new color system.</strong></p>
      <p>We introduced a mirroring logic for the surface colors, consisting of 5 shades each from a 20-step generated palette, 
        with an additional shared color that connects the light and dark tones for certain components. All colors from this 
        palette are added to the tokens at the brand level to preserve each step along with the logic between them. 
        We reference them at the respective theme level.</p>
    <img src="assets/revised-color-system.jpg" alt="Revised color system with contrast passing" />
    <p>Having 20 shades instead of just the 11 that are actually used provides us with flexibility in achieving proper 
      contrast with brand colors.</p>
    <p>Text colors are based on the darkest and lightest palette colors and are modified with global variables to 
      create high, medium, and low emphasis, similar to Material Design's color system. With this approach, we managed 
      to achieve AA compliance standards for our most prominent components for certain brands.</p>

    <h4>Redesigning Components with the New Token Set</h4>
    <p><strong>We began field testing these new color tokens by redesigning a handful of our most common UI components. 
      This allowed us to assess the flexibility of the custom properties and observe how quickly the Token Studio plugin 
      renders updates across different brands and tones at various atomic levels.</strong></p>
    <img src="assets/redesigned-components.jpg" alt="Redesigned components in the organism" />
    <p>In the tab component, the new border radius token, along with smarter usage and reduction of surface colors, provides 
      more emphasis on the content. The new system of text and surface colors allowed us to remove the brand color from the 
      title text while achieving an AA grade contrast ratio.</p>
    <p>For our market selector, I began moving away from desktop-specific controls and started utilizing brand-level color tokens. 
      The navigation chips offer a native mobile experience and reduce the need for custom UI components. They also help distinguish 
      the selection from other options while the horizontal swipe interaction simplifies the UX by eliminating an extra 
      step / layer from the z-axis compared to the original dropdown solution.</p>
    <p>In case of the event result selector, the new border radius token and smaller gaps between the buttons led to better 
      cohesion within an event's selections. With the reduction of the dimension tokens, the selection buttons now use a 
      standardized height instead of a custom value.</p>
    <p>Based on these examples, we began building on our existing Design System, revisiting components with the new tokens 
      to support a duo-tone appearance and an updated overall design.</p>

    <h4>From Design to Code</h4>
    <p>Once we confirmed that the components worked as expected in Figma, we presented the proof of concept to our key stakeholders, 
      UI team members, and Frontend Architects. Together, we began setting up the deployment part of the token pipeline.</p>
    <img src="assets/token-pipeline.jpg" alt="Design Token Pipeline from Figma to Production code" />
    <p>After the resolver was in place to translate our design tokens to CSS variables in the production code, we rolled out our very 
      first token set to the aforementioned Nordic brand in March 2024. The plan for this year is to continue with the rest of 
      our brands, which means more than 15 individual themes, along with their light and dark variants.</p>
   
    <p><strong>Since we previously didn't have a standardized handover process, I suggested extending the scope of this project to 
      include the standardization of our visual handovers to developers, product owners, and quality assurance personnel in order to 
      streamline the end-to-end development process.</strong></p>
    <p>To achieve this, I began experimenting with the 
      <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1205622541257680763/eightshapes-specs" target="_blank">EightShapes Specs plugin</a> 
      developed by Nathan Curtis, creating complex UI component specs along with all available variants of their subatomic particles.</p>
    <img src="assets/component-specs.jpg" alt="Component Specs for the Main Navigation" />
    <p>The Sportsbook design team decided to start to use the plugin with a limited set of features, outputting basic visuals 
      to reduce the delivery time of our first brands. As the next step, we are planning to introduce more features, including token 
      consumption details, and a standardized format for generated specs to introduce a comprehensive, living documentation for our new 
      duo-tone design system components.</p>

    <h4>Plans for the Future</h4>
    <p><strong>My long-term goal is to create an ecosystem and culture where designers can craft highly personalized or at least geo-location 
      agnostic components. This will enhance the user experience and increase the company's overall relevance in our key markets.</strong>
    <p>With the new token architecture and color system, the UI design team is technically ready to upgrade our existing components and 
      craft new ones as requested by our product backlog. In the upcoming months, we need to agree on a token documentation format 
      with the Front End developers and Product Owners. Additionally, since the number of component upgrade requests has increased 
      with the redesign initiative, we need to enhance our prioritization process and update our roadmap for the year.</p>
    <img src="assets/component-integration-graph.jpg" alt="Component implementation graph" />
    <p>In addition to following up on feedback regarding the new system, its documentation, and processes from all product development 
      participants through regular designer conversations and workshops, product-development Slack channels, wiki page idea pools, etc., 
      I started to draw up plans for the next year. This includes a Storybook integration MVP and the introduction of a more dynamic 
      and automated color palette creation based on the OKLCH color namespace to enhance the elevation system of our UI components and 
      speed up our component creation cycle.</p>
    <p>With the help of this new approach, we can begin creating alternate token sets to experiment with existing product brands and 
      study significant modifications, such as accessibility enhancements.</p>
    <p><strong>This new component-building method will enable us to increase our competitiveness in current markets and introduce our 
      product to new markets, thanks to the flexibility of our Design System components.</strong></p>
